### Create a reference
This code will ask easypay for a new reference which can be payed using MB or credit-card
```php
$payment_info = [
            'o_name' => "Your name",
            'o_email' => 'Your email',
            't_value' => '29.00',
            'o_description' => 'Here is your description',
            'o_obs' => 'Here is your observations',
            'o_mobile' => 'Here is your mobile',
            't_key' => 'Here is the ID of your order'
    ];
    
$easypay = new EasyPay($payment_info);

$reference = $easypay->createReference();

if($reference["ep_status"] == "ok0"){
    $entidade=$reference["ep_entity"];
    $referencia=$reference["ep_reference"];
    $valor=$reference["ep_value"];

    return view('refMB', ['entidade'=>$entidade, 'referencia'=> $referencia, 'valor' => $valor]);
}
else{
    return view('erro');
}


```
This will return an array with the following : 
```

Array
(
    [ep_status] => ok0
    [ep_message] => ep_country and ep_entity and ep_user and ep_cin ok and validation by code;code ok - new reference generated - NEW REFERENCE - 
    [ep_cin] => your CIN
    [ep_user] => your USER
    [ep_entity] => your ENTITY
    [ep_reference] => generated REFERENCE
    [ep_value] => Asked value
    [t_key] => Order ID sent
    [ep_link] => Link to pay using credit-card
)
```
Now you can do what you want with this information, maybe you might want save to database to build user history payments.

### Method to receive notifications in real time
When easypay get his payment they will call the URL that you provided to them which will execute a similiar method like below, for more details see (https://docs.easypay.pt/workflow/payment-notification)
```php
    $easypay = new EasyPay($request->input());

    $xml = $easypay->processPaymentInfo();

    return \Response::make($xml, '200')->header('Content-Type', 'text/xml');

```
This block of code will store into database the document number of the payment received from easypay, update with more info sent from them and return xml to easypay. (Step 4 : https://docs.easypay.pt/workflow/payment-notification)

### Get all payments
This will return an array with all of your payments from easypay
```php
$easypay = new EasyPay();

$all_payments = $easypay->fetchAllPayments();
```

and thats it ....
